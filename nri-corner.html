                                    At times, navigating the legalities of a new home purchase can be a daunting task. To make the process easier, we have compiled the basic legal considerations of acquiring a property in India. Additionally, you can get in touch with us with any specific queries.
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Non-resident Indians holding an Indian passport do not require any permission from RBI to acquire an immovable property for bonafide residential purposes.</li>
<li>Non-resident Indians holding an Indian passport may pay the purchase consideration either by remittance of funds from abroad through normal banking channels or out of their NRO/ NRE/ FCNR account.</li>
<li>Ensure that the title report of the property contains no conditions written in fine print and that there are no specific reservations by the State Government.</li>
<li>Look for specific clearance reports. For instance, if the construction is near a seafront, you will need to check for a Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance. If the project is being constructed over or in close vicinity of a heritage building, you must check for any heritage reservations for the premises. The idea is to ensure that you do not get stuck with a property that is or may get caught in any sort of a dispute. Lack of clearance of titles also means that you will not be able to avail home loans.</li>

                    <!--<p>&nbsp;</p>-->
                    <h4>HOME LOANS</h4>
                    <p>The Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are recognized under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Every bank and housing finance company follows the RBI guidelines to define an NRI - "An Indian citizen who holds a valid document like an Indian passport and who stays abroad for employment or for carrying on business or vocation outside India or stays abroad under circumstances indicating an intention for an uncertain duration of stay abroad is an NRI."</p>
                    <p><strong>Broadly categorized, Non-Resident Indians qualifying for NRI housing loans are:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="style-dot">
                        <li>Indian citizens who stay abroad for employment or for carrying on business or vocation outside India or for any other purpose in circumstances indicating an indefinite period of stay abroad</li>
                        <li>Government servants who are posted abroad on duty with the Indian missions and similar other agencies set up abroad by the Government of India, where the officials draw their salaries out of Government resources</li>
                        <li>Government servants deputed abroad on assignments with foreign Governments or regional/ international agencies like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Health Organization (WHO), Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)</li>
                        <li>Officials of the State Government and Public Sector undertakings deputed abroad on temporary assignments or posted to their branches or offices abroad</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!--<div class="grayBox-content">-->
                        <p>Documents required for Resident Indians and NRIs for getting home loans are different in some respects. Home loans for NRIs are available for construction of new houses/ flats, purchase of old house/ flat addition/ alteration to an existing house and repairs/ renovation etc. NRIs can avail of loans by mortgaging an existing residential property. However, for availing home loans, NRIs have to fulfill certain conditions, according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. They should have stayed in India for a period of 182 days or more within an assessment year or they should have stayed in India for at least a total of one year or more.</p>                      
                        <p>The FDI policy that permits FDI up to 100% from a foreign/ NRI investor under the automatic route has boosted NRI confidence. Banks have attractive NRI housing schemes to accommodate the housing needs of NRIs. From the stables of HFCs, NRI housing finance plans with suitable repayment options are available.</p>                     
                        <p>Last but not the least, NRIs should take due care while selecting their home loan provider companies or HFCs. Considering the geographical distances involved, it is significant that loan seekers associate with a proactive and responsive HFC.</p>

                    <div class="hr"></div>
                    <h4>ELIGIBILITY FOR NRI</h4>
                    <p>The eligibility criterias for NRIs differ from Resident Indians based on a few parameters. The parameters include:</p>
                    <div class="table-scroll">
                        <table class="table-style-1">
                            <tbody><tr>
                                <th>Age</th>
                                <th>Qualification</th>
                                <th>Income</th>
                                <th>Payment options</th>
                                <th>Number of dependants</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>The loan applicant has to be 21 years of age.</td>
                                <td>The NRI loan seeker has to be a graduate.</td>
                                <td>The loan applicant has to have a minimum monthly income of $ 2,000 (although, this criterion may differ across HFCs). The eligibility is also determined by the stability and continuity of employment or business.</td>
                                <td>The NRI also has to route his EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) cheques through his NRE/ NRO account. He cannot make payments from another source such as, his savings account in India.</td>
                                <td>The eligibility of the applicant is also determined by the number of dependents, assets and liabilities.</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody></table>
                    </div>
                    <p>Home loans for an NRI applicant ranges from a minimum of INR. 5 lakhs to a maximum of INR. 1 crore, based on the repayment capacity and the cost of the property, which although is variable by the priorities of the home loan provider. An applicant will be eligible for a maximum of 85% of the cost of the property or the cost of construction as applicable and 75% of the cost of land in case of purchase of land, based on the repayment capacity of the borrower.</p>
                    <p>However, the eligibility can be enhanced by applying for home loans with a co-applicant who has a separate source of income. Also, the rate of interest for home loans to NRIs is higher than those offered to Resident Indians. The difference is somewhere between 0.25%-0.50%. Some HFCs also have an internally earmarked 'negative criterion' for NRI home loans. As such, the NRIs who hail from locations that are marked as being 'negative' in the books of HFCs, find it difficult to get a home loan.</p>
                    <div class="hr"></div>
                    <h4>RBI DIRECTIVE LOANS</h4>
                    <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), purchasing immovable property in India must pay for the acquisition by funds received in India through normal banking channels by way of inward remittance from outside the country.</p>
                    <p>The NRIs and Resident Indians can also acquire immovable property in India other than agricultural property, plantation or a farmhouse. It has issued certain directives for sanctioning home loans to Non-Resident Indians.</p>
                    <p><strong>The guidelines provided are:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="style-dot">
                        <li>The home loan amount should not exceed 85% of the cost of the dwelling unit, As the remaining 15% needs to be provided by one's own contribution towards the cost of unit financed</li>
                        <li>The cost of dwelling unit which is by own contribution financed less the loan amount, can be met from direct remittances from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and/ or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India</li>
                        <li>However, repayment of the loan, comprising of the principal and interest including all the charges are to be remitted to the HFC from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and /or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!--<div class="grayBox-content">-->
                        <p>The repayment option for NRIs is that they can pay through the funds held in any non-resident account maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the regulations made by the RBI from time to time. </p>
                    <!--</div>-->
                    <div class="hr"></div>
                    <h4>DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR LOAN</h4>
                    <p>Apart from the documents mentioned below, a vital document required while processing any NRI home loan is the ‘Power of Attorney’ (POA). Since the borrower is not based in India, the POA is important because HFCs would need a 'representative' 'in lieu of' the NRI to deal with if necessary. Although not obligatory, the POA is usually drawn on the NRI's parents/ wife/ children.</p>
                    <p><strong>The documents needed for obtaining NRI home loans are:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="style-dot">
                        <li>Passport and Visa</li>
    <li>A copy of the appointment letter and contract from the company employing the applicant</li>

										<p>Tip: You may also file a tax return if you have to claim a refund. This may happen where the tax deducted at source is more than the actual tax liability. Suppose your taxable income for the year was below INR.1.6 lakh but the bank deducted tax at source on your interest amount, you can claim a refund by filing your tax return.<br />
											Another instance is when you have a capital loss that can be set-off against capital gains. Tax may have been deducted at source on the capital gains, but you can set-off (or carry forward) capital loss against the gain and lower your actual tax liability. In such cases, you would need to file a tax return.</p>
